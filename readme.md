## What does this repository do?

Automation setup by a simple script.

This project changes a number of settings and configures software on MacOS.

Before you actually execute the script, please make sure what is dotfiles and what does it do.

<details>
<summary><b>What is dotfiles？</b></summary>

> Dotfiles are important files that will play an integral role in your career as a software developer.

</details>

<details>

<summary><b>Why use dotfiles?</b></summary>

> You spend a sufficient amount of time fine-tuning your setup. You curate configurations and settings that best suit your workflow, aesthetic, and preferences. And you end up with a development environment that helps you, personally, be more productive.
>
> What if after all that time you spent, you now have to switch to a new, different machine? Does that mean you have to start all over again from the beginning?
>
> How would you remember the exact settings and commands you used?
>
> Or what if you have a second machine and you want your set up to be exactly the same on both systems?
>
> One of the main goals of developers is to automate repetitive tasks.
>
> Creating a dotfile repository that is source-controlled and hosted on GitHub will save you time when you want to set up a new computer and install the exact same settings you created for your previous one.
>
> That way all your settings and preferences can be reusable and consistent on other machines.
